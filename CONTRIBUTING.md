# Toolzin

This is a Next.js project that provides a collection of useful online tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your Google Analytics measurement ID if you want to use analytics.

Then, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🛠️ Features

## 🔍 How it works
